# IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE ON ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION PATTERN IN ALBERTA, CANADA
Completion date (DD/MM/YYYY): 03/11/2024

# 1. Background

The connection between temperature and electricity consumption is a well-established concept, often described by a U-shaped pattern. When temperatures drop significantly during winter, electricity use rises as heating systems work harder to maintain warmth. Similarly, soaring temperatures increase reliance on air conditioning and cooling systems during summer, driving up electricity demand. However, this relationship isnâ€™t uniform. Factors like local climate, urbanization, and industrial activity create variations in energy use. For example, urban areas with dense populations and industrial hubs tend to consume more electricity due to higher energy demands. Climate change adds another layer of complexity, as rising temperatures can exacerbate electricity needs, particularly in regions already struggling with energy shortages. This project, thus explores  these dynamics, by examining how seasonal temperatures  such as summer heatwaves and winter cold snaps affect electricity consumption across nine Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) regions.
